Login-Rules
===========

Login Rules is a simple application used in the Commerce Computer Labs at student logon. It is a full screen application that displays a rules page and a background advertising page. The student needs to scroll down the entire rules window before being able to accept the rules and continuing on to Windows. On acceptance of the rules, a copy of the file is made to their personal network folder. Created by Craig Lotter, March 2007
